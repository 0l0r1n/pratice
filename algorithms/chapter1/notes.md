# Chapter 1 Notes

- An algorithm must solve a general, well specified problem
- An algorithmic problem is specified by describing the complete set of instances it must work on - your algorithm should solve them all otherwise it's incorrect. Distinction between a problem and instance of a problem.
- Example: Sorting is the problem to be solved. It could be sorting numbers or names. Insertion Sort is an algorithm that solves that problem
- An algorithm could be reasonable and yet it could be bad
- There is a fundamental difference between algorithms, which always produce a correct result, and heuristics which usually does a good job but does not provide a guarantee.
- Reasonable looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Algorithm correctness is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.
