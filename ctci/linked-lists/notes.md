# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes. In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the list. In a doubly linked list, each node points to the next and previous node.

- Many linked list problems can be solved using recursion
- Remember the runner technique (especially when you already know something about the length of the linked list)
