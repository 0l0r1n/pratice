# GraphQL

Component that parses, validates and executes GraphQL queries/mutations is commonly referred to as the GraphQL server. Swagger/WSDL or anything else assumes a deep and precise understanding of the client's data requirements upfront.

GraphQL hands the decision of what data gets fetched to the client, opening in turn a path to a much smoother API evolution. Idea of schema-first: central contract between client and server describing all types of data and operations (queries and mutations) upon those types the server offers. In addition to independence between client-server and easy mocking.
